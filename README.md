<h1>Web Scraping - Epic Games Store</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort. In this project, I will scrape the data from the Epic Games Store website and store it in a structured format for later analysis.</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>epic_games_store_scraping.ipynb</b> - Jupyter notebook with the code for scraping the data</li>
<li><b>epic_games_store.csv</b> - CSV file with the scraped data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>The code is written in Python 3.7.3. If you don't have Python installed you can find it <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>. The code is in the Jupyter notebook <b>epic_games_store_scraping.ipynb</b>. To run the code you need to install the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>requests</b> - To make requests and download the HTML content of the pages</li>
<li><b>BeautifulSoup</b> - To parse the HTML content and extract the data</li>
<li><b>pandas</b> - To store the data in a structured format and save it to a CSV file</li>
</ul>

<h2>Run</h2>
<p>To run the code you need to open the Jupyter notebook <b>epic_games_store_scraping.ipynb</b> and run all the cells. The data will be stored in the file <b>epic_games_store.csv</b>.</p>
